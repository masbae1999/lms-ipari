# Duitku Plugin Security Fix Implementation Guide

## 1. Security Issue Summary

A critical security vulnerability was discovered in the Duitku enrollment plugin, allowing guest users to:

-   Access paid courses through direct URLs without authentication
-   Be registered as enrolled users in courses requiring payment
-   Bypass membership validation mechanisms

## 2. Implemented Security Fixes

### 2.1 Guest Access Prevention (`lib.php`)

-   Enhanced `allow_enrol()` method to block guest users from accessing paid courses
-   Added exception handling for special cases (callbacks, CLI scripts, AJAX requests)
-   Fixed parent method calls to ensure proper inheritance

### 2.2 Access Validation (`duitku_helper.php`)

-   Added `validate_access()` method to properly verify user authentication
-   Implemented context-aware validation that works correctly with different page types
-   Added graceful redirection to the login page

### 2.3 Payment Callback Security (`membership_callback.php`)

-   Improved payment callback handling to allow external services to function
-   Removed session validation that was blocking legitimate payment notifications
-   Added proper logging for all callback activities

### 2.4 Course Access Control (`locallib.php`)

-   Created robust course access validation with error handling
-   Added special handling for admin users and teachers
-   Implemented proper HTTP response headers for security
-   Added fallback to standard enrollment checks

### 2.5 Database Cleanup (`cleanup_guests.php`)

-   Created utility to remove guest users from enrollment tables
-   Added SQL to clean up role assignments and membership records
-   Implemented verbose logging for tracking cleanup progress

## 3. Validation and Testing

### 3.1 Database Cleanup

Run the cleanup script to remove existing guest enrollments:

```bash
php enrol/duitku/cli/cleanup_guests.php --verbose
```

### 3.2 Security Verification

Run the verification script to confirm all fixes are properly implemented:

```bash
php enrol/duitku/cli/verify_security.php --verbose
```

### 3.3 Manual Testing Scenarios

1. **Guest Access Test**:

    - Log out completely
    - Try to access a paid course URL directly
    - Verify redirect to login page

2. **Callback Functionality**:

    - Test a payment callback with proper parameters
    - Verify callback is processed without session errors

3. **Admin Access**:
    - Verify administrators can still access all courses
    - Confirm admin pages load without errors

## 4. Troubleshooting

### 4.1 HTTP 500 Errors

If you encounter HTTP 500 errors after implementing these fixes:

1. **Check Server Logs**:

    ```bash
    tail -f /var/log/apache2/error.log
    ```

2. **Enable Moodle Debugging**:
   In config.php:

    ```php
    $CFG->debug = E_ALL;
    $CFG->debugdisplay = 1;
    ```

3. **Common Solutions**:
    - The context validation may be too strict - we've fixed this by making the check conditional
    - Callbacks may be failing - we've made special exceptions for payment processor callbacks
    - Course access checks may be failing - we've added robust error handling

### 4.2 Payment Processor Issues

If payment processors can't communicate with your site:

1. Remove any session validation in callback handlers
2. Ensure the `allow_enrol()` method has special exceptions for callbacks
3. Add proper HTTP headers in responses

## 5. Future Security Considerations

1. Regularly run the cleanup script to remove any guest enrollments
2. Monitor logs for unusual access patterns
3. Consider implementing more granular access controls
4. Update this plugin when new Moodle versions are released
